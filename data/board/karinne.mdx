Karinne Tennenbaum is a junior in Saybrook College pursuing a BS in Ecology & Evolutionary Biology on the Biodiversity and Environment track. She fell in love with birds in second grade after participating in a Science Olympiad's "Feathered Friends" event. In high school, she flew into ornithology: founding her high school's birding club, creating a novice birding podcast, volunteering in bird rehabilitation, conducting research on the effect of lead on songbirds after the Flint Water Crisis, and more. At Yale, she has had diverse research experiences, including microfossil fish teeth, hummingbird structural coloration, Ranavirus epidemics, and secondary succession. Her work has taken her to the Yale-Myers Forest, Chile's Cape Horn, and Panama's Barro Colorado Island, where she garnered an interest in tropical bird communities. Beyond the lab, Karinne is an active member of the Yale Ballroom Dance Team and Yale Club Jump Rope. You can often find her playing Catan, strumming a guitar, or dashing on the pickleball court.
