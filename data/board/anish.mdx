Anish Lakkapragada is a first-year in Branford College pursuing a double major in Computer Science and Mathematics. Anish picked up birding throughout high school in the Bay Area, CA and is excited to see East Coast birds during his time at Yale. 
When birdwatching, you can almost find Anish with a camera. Anish's favorite bird to see is a plain ol' Blue Jay (for now). Outside of birdwatching, Anish enjoys napping (without an alarm) and lifting.
