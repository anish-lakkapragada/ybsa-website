Molly Hill is a senior in Grace Hopper majoring in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. She has been a birder since high school, and has studied ornithology with Richard Prum throughout her time at Yale. Her research interests include bird social behavior and vocal cultures, particularly in parrots. As a birder, she is never happier than when standing on a hill hawkwatching or standing in a parking lot looking at gulls.
