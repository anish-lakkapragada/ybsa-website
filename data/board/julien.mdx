Julien Amsellem is a sophomore in Silliman College studying Ecology & Evolutionary Biology. He’s had passion for birds since age six, when his first Pileated Woodpecker, seen on a brisk March day outside his house, was all the convincing he needed to become a serious birder. In the 13 years since, Julien’s fervor for ornithology has only grown. He conducted two research projects on Northeastern birds, one examining the impact of ungulate overbrowsing on understory species’ populations and another on interspecific dominance hierarchies at feeders during breeding season. In search of his goal to see the world’s birds, he has traveled to the Sky Islands of Arizona, the prairies of Montana, the tropical rainforests of Panama and Costa Rica, and the scrub lowlands of Mexico. Locally, he continues to lead birdwalks for the Linnaean Society of NY, various Audubon Society chapters, and his hometown of Hastings-on-Hudson. Apart from birds, Julien can be found playing most racket sports, baking a tray of delightfully warm cookies, or engaging in a drawn-out board game with friends.
